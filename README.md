This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is a simple clone of Dropbox that shows how to upload, rename and delete files. Built by following Sonny Sangha's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdEY-ZnEikg) (Letâ€™s build Dropbox 2.0 with NEXT.JS 14! (React, Clerk, Shadcn, Firebase, Drag/Drop, CRUD, TS)). Files and file details are stored in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and [clerk](https://clerk.com/) is used for authentication. For both services, you will need to create accounts.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Environment configuration
Start by generating a .env.local file within the project's root directory. Subsequently, navigate to your Clerk account and add a new application. In the left-hand menu, of the newly created app, access the API Keys section under Developers. Locate and note down the NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY. Paste these keys into the .env.local file.
