## About

This Next.js 14 project serves as a basic replica of Dropbox. It demonstrates the implementation of file upload, renaming, and deletion functionalities. The project was crafted by adhering to Sonny Sangha's tutorial titled "Letâ€™s build Dropbox 2.0 with NEXT.JS 14! (React, Clerk, Shadcn, Firebase, Drag/Drop, CRUD, TS)."

File data and details are stored in Firebase, while Clerk handles the authentication process. To utilize both services, it is necessary to create accounts for Firebase and Clerk.

## Environment configuration
Start by generating a .env.local file within the project's root directory. Subsequently, navigate to your Clerk account and add a new application. In the left-hand menu, of the newly created app, access the API Keys section under Developers. Locate and note down the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`. Paste these keys into the .env.local file.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
